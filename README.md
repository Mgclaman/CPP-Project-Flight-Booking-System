# CPP-Project-Flight-Booking-System
 An efficient flight booking system can be implemented using a priority queue 
based on a binary search tree (BST). The BST allows for efficient insertion and 
deletion of flights based on their priority, which can be determined by factors 
such as departure time, arrival time, price, and passenger status. The priority 
queue ensures that flights with higher priority are processed first, ensuring that 
passengers with urgent travel needs are accommodated promptly. 
In this system, flights are represented as nodes in the BST, with each node 
containing information about the flight's departure time, arrival time, price, 
passenger status, and priority. When a new flight booking request arrives, a new 
node is created with the corresponding flight information and inserted into the 
BST. The BST's insertion algorithm efficiently places the new node in the 
correct position based on its priority. 
When a passenger enquires about available flights, the system searches the BST 
to retrieve flights that match the passenger's preferences. The search algorithm 
efficiently traverses the BST, starting with the highest priority nodes, ensuring 
that the passenger is presented with the most suitable flight options first. 
To cancel a flight booking, the system locates the corresponding node in the 
BST and removes it. The BST's deletion algorithm efficiently removes the node 
without disrupting the structure of the tree. This ensures that the priority queue 
remains organized, and that flight processing continues smoothly. 
Overall, implementing a flight booking system using a priority queue based on a 
BST provides an efficient and organized approach to managing flight bookings, 
ensuring that passengers with urgent travel needs are prioritized while 
maintaining a streamlined booking process.
